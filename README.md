# Open-Source-Vulnerability-testing-tool-to-assess-Web-Applications-
This tool deals about binding the known multiple vulnerabilities to find the overall vulnerability of a web application. The impact of the vulnerability is analyzed by combining multiple penetration testing tools which automatically classify the exploit model to gather information using the signature patterns (Regular Expressions). Finally the exploit information can be viewed in the form of a report so that security patch of the vulnerabilities can be performed.
