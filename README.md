# Open-Source-Vulnerability-testing-tool-to-assess-Web-Applications-
This tool deals about binding the known multiple vulnerabilities to find the overall vulnerability of a web application. The impact of the vulnerability is analyzed by combining multiple penetration testing tools which automatically classify the exploit model to gather information using the signature patterns (Regular Expressions). Finally the exploit information can be viewed in the form of a report so that security patch of the vulnerabilities can be performed. 

VGATHER:

VGATHER that combine the multiple search engines, plugins and open source gathering tool. It collect the every information that related to the target and explore the hidden details. This tool connected with the some search engines like [Hackertarget.com, Dnsdumpster.com, censys.io and zoomeye.org] and intelligence tools to collect the information.


VSEARCH:

VSEARCH comes with an idea to minimize the false positive by detecting the same vulnerability over the multiple tools and verifying that vulnerability is really present or not. VSEARCH is a collection of vulnerability scanning tool and these all tools are taken from in-built tools on penetration testing operating systems. In-built tools are fully trusted and these automation tools are verified by many then only implemented on operating system. It is really very helpful for penetration tester to identify the vulnerabilities. After collecting the multiple tools, it automate the each tools one by one and store the response in temp file. When the response match the word vulnerable it pop up and store that response on other file. When the same vulnerability is detected by the other tool also it pop-up and store the response on same directory of pervious same vulnerability file.

Once all the tools are completed its scan it started to produce the final report and it shows the vulnerabilities list and how many vulnerabilities are identified by the multiple tools. Over the result and came to the conclusion like these vulnerabilities are really present and these are false positives. It contain many feature to detect the vulnerabilities like DNS based vulnerability, WAF detection, SQL vulnerability, XSS vulnerability, CSRF vulnerabilities, Open redirect, IDOR vulnerabilities, Local file inclusion , Remote file inclusion, SSRF, RCE , Certificate based vulnerabilities and etc. 

VFIND:

VFIND identify the installed software on the server (OS, Middleware, CMS, etc.) by using signature pattern matching from the response and it try to figure out the exploit model for the identified products. 

Step 1: Collect HTTP Responses

VFIND gather many HTTP responses over the crawling method. It try to analysis the target and then it start to crawl using the python package called scrapy . Scrapy is the python package that used to crawl the web page and applications details then stored the gathered details. So, VFIND just try to gather the response and information from the target on its first phase.

Step 2: Identify the product

VFIND can able to identify the products using string pattern matching [unique signature]. It identify the products like CMS, OS, and Framework easily using regular expressions. It contain stored regular expressions that are used to identify the products over the HTTP response. These regular expression are differ for the each products by their string, values and signature.


Step 3: Finding exploit model and reporting

After the two steps, it try to detect the exploit model for the gathered products by using the NVD [National vulnerability Database] \, it contain the exploit models list and it try to filter the exploit model [CVE Number] for the gathered information from the database. It also contain Searchsploit [Exploit-DB tool], that also used to gather the exploit model from the Exploit-DB database. After filtering the correct exploit model then it generate the report about the products and exploit model [CVE Number]. It very helpful to identify the exploit model and the products that are running on the target application.
